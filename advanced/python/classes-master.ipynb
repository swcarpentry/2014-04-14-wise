      "## Object Orientation\n",
      "\n",
      "**Object oriented programming** is a way of thinking about and defining how different pieces of software and ideas work together. In object-oriented programming, there are two main interfaces: **classes** and **objects**.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* **Classes** are types of things such as int, float, person, or square.\n",
      "* **Objects** are **instances** of those types such a 1, 42.0, me, and a square with side length 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike functional or procedural paradigms, there are three main features that classes provide.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Encapsulation:** Classes are container which may have any kind of other programming element living on them: variables, functions, and even other classes. In Python, members of a class are known as **attributes** for normal variables and **methods** for functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Inheritence:** A class may automatically gain all of the attributes and methods from another class it is related to.  The new class is called a  **subclass** or sometimes a **subtype**.  Multiple levels of inheritance sets up a **class heirarchy**. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "    - Shape is a class with an area attribute.\n",
      "    - Rectangle is a subclass of Shape.\n",
      "    - Square is a subclass of Rectangle (which also makes it a subclass of Shape).\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "* **Polymorphism:** Subclasses may override methods and attributes of their parents in a way that suitable to them.  For example:.\n",
      "\n",
      "    - Shape is a class with an area method.\n",
      "    - Square is a subclass of Shape which computes area by $x^2$.\n",
      "    - Circle is a subclass of Shape which computes area by $\\pi r^2$\n",
      "\n",
      "If this seems more complicated than writing functions and calling them in sequence that is because it is!   However, obeject orientation enables authors to cleanly separate out ideas into independent classes.  It is also good to know because in many languages - Python included - it is the way that you modify the type system. \n",
